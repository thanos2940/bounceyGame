# Bouncey Game
A simple Javascript game, a variation of "Breakout" where the player must keep the ball from falling of the bottom of the screen.

Javascript and P5.js were used for the game implementation, HTML and CSS where used to host the game on the browser.

This project was made in context of a university class as an assignment. There are still bugs (especially in the Ball physics and collisions) to be fixed and polishing to be done at some later point if at all.
